Hello Brothers,
So we are getting started with Version Control Systems
Such that if there is anything we need to do remotely...
Github is our brother.

So if you see this, I take it you have managed to pull the project.
So all you have to do is edit 
Code.py to print your name and email

then commit it to a branch named <your name>

Thank you..

you are welcome!
